  Drivers indexed by lake used to drive lake models. There are seven zip folder that share identical formatting. Six files correspond to downscaled Global Circulation Models (Notaro et al. 2016), 
  and one (NLDAS) are results from contemporary (1979-2015) meterology. Each folder contains a driver for each study lake, and has identical attributes (described above). NLDAS drivers (NLDAS.zip) are described in 
  Mitchell et al. 2004. The remaining six files are drivers from the models described in Notaro et al. 2015. 

file-format: Separate comma separated text files zipped into seven single files
