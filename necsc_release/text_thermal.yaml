data-description: >-
  Temperature metrics for study lakes grouped by year and lake. There are seven files that share identical formatting. Six files correspond to downscaled Global Circulation Models (Notaro et al. 2016), 
  and one (NLDAS) are results from contemporary (1979-2015) meterology. Each file contains the same attributes (described above). NLDAS drivers (NLDAS_thermal_metrics.tsv) are described in 
  Mitchell et al. 2004. The remaining six files are driven with models described in Notaro et al. 2015.
