  Climate change has been shown to influence lake temperatures globally. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes, 
  we modelled daily water temperature profiles for 10,774 lakes in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin for contemporary (1979-2015) and future (2020-2040 and 2080-2100) time 
  periods with climate models based on the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, the worst-case emission scenario. From simulated temperatures, we derived commonly used, 
  ecologically relevant annual metrics of thermal conditions for each lake. We included all available supporting metadata including satellite and in-situ observations of water clarity, 
  maximum observed lake depth, land-cover based estimates of surrounding canopy height and observed water temperature profiles (used here for validation). 
  This unique dataset offers landscape-level insight into the future impact of climate change on lakes.

process-description: >-
  At the core of the modeling framework is a lake hydrodynamic model that uses inputs of lake-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate water temperature. 
  Our chosen model is the open source, General Lake Model (GLM) version 2.2.0. GLM is a one-dimensional dynamical model which simplifies lakes using a vertical approximation, 
  where horizontal variability is ignored. GLM uses a Lagrangian approach to layer structure where layers can split and combine based on changing vertical gradients. 
  GLM is a modern, implementation of other one-dimensional models. We used GLM to run individual lake simulations according to the processes described in Winslow et al. 2017. 
  Outputs for water temperature were extracted at various depths and written or summarized to the files included in this set of data. The glmtools R package was used for this processing.
