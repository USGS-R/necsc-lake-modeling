data-description: >-
  Model output from running the General Lake Model (Hipsey et al. 2013) for each lake, for each driver type, for each daily timestep. Because lakes vary in depth, some lake output files contain 
  fewer columns than others. Files are split into multiple zipped folders to keep sizes close to 2GB. 
  For each of seven drivers, there exists an index file for mapping file names to associated zip folder. 
  The file names include the "site_id" that is used to describe unique lakes as a reference for this dataset. 
  All files share identical formatting.   Six drivers correspond to downscaled Global Circulation Models (Notaro et al. 2016), 
  and one (NLDAS) are results from contemporary (1979-2015) meterology. 
  Each file contains the same attributes (described above). NLDAS drivers are described in 
  Mitchell et al. 2004. The remaining six drivers are driven with models described in Notaro et al. 2015.
