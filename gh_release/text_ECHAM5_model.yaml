  Water temperatures were modeled for 2148 lakes across Wisconsin using the General Lake Model (GLM) between 1989 and 2014 under the A2 emissions scenario for future (2040-2064 and 2065-2089) conditions. 
  The ECHAM5.0 GCM was used for this dataset.  
  From these depth-discrete water temperatures, a number of different common metrics of water temperature were calculated at the annual scale.
